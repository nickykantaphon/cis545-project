# Credit Card Approval Prediction

Credit score is a prevalent method to control risks in the financial industry. By utilizing personal information and applicant data, we are able to predict the possibility of defaulting from credit card borrowings. Machine learning algorithms can come into play to help financial institutions decide whether the applicants have good or bad credit, in order to make a judgement about credit card approval. Many banks offer approval decisions for credit cards immediately after applications have been filled. If any financial institutions had an accurate model to predict applicants’ credit behaviors, they would be able to reduce risks of defaulting while saving costs, since manually analyzing applications is both time-consuming and error-prone.

Through this project, we will be able to understand first-hand how financial institutions use historical and personal data to build a model that helps determine whether new applicants have good or bad credit.

We will work with Credit Card Dataset for Machine Learning from Kaggle. Our data includes 2 tables that are linked by ID: (1) application_record.csv containing applicants’ personal information, which can be used as features to run predictive models, and (2) credit_record.csv recording user behaviors of credit cards, which can be used as an output or dependent variable to determine whether the users should have good or bad credit.

Our goal ultimately is to develop the model to perform binary classification: determining whether, given a set of input or independent variables, this specific applicant has a good or bad credit. We would also conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find interesting trends or correlations in the dataset as well as visualizing the data to gain more insights into the datasets.

We will utilize supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to train our model to perform binary classification, i.e., predicting whether a certain customer would have good or bad credit behavior.
